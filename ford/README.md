# Ford

A local Django showroom with 20 Ford entries covering every model year from 2010 through 2027. Prices, cash purchase requests, financing estimates, test-drive bookings, and newsletter signup are for demonstration.

## Run on Windows

Open PowerShell in this folder. If `.venv` is already present, run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
```

Open [the local site](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

For a fresh download, install Python 3.12 or 3.13 and open PowerShell in the repository's `ford` folder. Run the complete setup below.

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/. The migration step creates a new SQLite database and loads all 20 vehicles automatically. Existing accounts or a copied database are not needed. Create an account through the website to try sign-in and favorites.

## Run on macOS or Linux

Install Python 3.12 or 3.13, open a terminal in `ford`, and run:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python manage.py migrate
.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver
```

## Included assets and verification

All vehicle images, the desktop and mobile hero videos, fonts, icons, and the compiled Arabic translation are included locally. After installing dependencies, the showroom's own pages and assets work without an external asset service. External Ford and social links need an internet connection.

Keep `showroom/static/`, `showroom/locale/`, and every file in `showroom/migrations/` when downloading or submitting the project. The `.venv` folder and `db.sqlite3` are created on the receiving computer.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py test
```


## Project layout

- `config/` contains the Django project settings and root URL configuration.
- `showroom/` contains the views, URL mapping, and `Car` model. Migrations create the SQLite schema and populate the inventory.
- `showroom/templates/showroom/` contains `base.html`, the page templates, and the shared car card.
- `showroom/static/showroom/` contains styles, JavaScript, photos, and locally served Google fonts and icons.

## Lab features

- The home, inventory, details and about views render inherited templates. The 20 vehicle detail pages share a detail template.
- Template links use named URLs. `Car.get_absolute_url()` resolves a detail URL from the model.
- `/cars/taurus/` passes the model slug as a path parameter. `/cars/?year=2026` filters the inventory via a query parameter.
- The header theme button posts to Django and persists the preference in the `ford_theme` cookie.
- The gallery, search, and mobile menu work locally. Guest favorites are stored in the browser, and signed-in favorites are stored against the account in SQLite. Recently viewed vehicles persist for seven days, comparison selections for two days, and filters for the tab session.

- All Cars compares two models via repeated query parameters, for example /cars/?compare=mustang-gt&compare=mustang-dark-horse#compare.
- Each detail page includes a full-screen photo viewer and a monthly estimate using the demo price, down payment, term, and annual rate.
- The header language toggle switches between English and Arabic, including right-to-left layout, vehicle information, forms and date labels. The language cookie preserves the choice. The Arabic PO source and compiled MO live in the showroom locale directory.
- Each vehicle has separate links for cash purchase, test-drive booking and installment estimates. The URL fragment opens the selected panel and scrolls to it.
- Test drives use Saudi time and offer six city choices. Bookings and purchase requests are saved in SQLite and can be reviewed in Django admin.
- Archival photo attribution is retained in the gallery records in the inventory data migration. Vehicle information links point to the reference used for each model.
